Hello, my name is Kacper
My interest in programming arose during my studies
master's degrees, where we learned the basics of programming in Phyton.
I used the knowledge I acquired there when writing my master's thesis.
After graduating, my professional path changed, but my passion and desire changed
exploring topics related to programming remained. My free time
I decided to spend it on education so that I could further my professional future
connect with work in IT. Currently, I am at the beginning of this path, but I care about it
a job in which I will be able to further develop and expand my vision
